# Cinematics

A project that I've started to practice using Unreal's cinematic features.

The basis of the project is a simple platformer where I've incorporated level sequences to use as cutscenes and the likes 
to help guide the player along.

Controls:

Movement:    WASD
Jump:        Spacebar
Pause:       Esc
Camera:      Mouse
Interaction: F
